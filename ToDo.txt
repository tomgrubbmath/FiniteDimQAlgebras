[X] Define FDQAs by asking for a list of matrices, the matrices encode the structure coefficients for multiplication 
[X] Define FDQA elements. They are implemented as a list. THE FIRST ENTRY OF THE LIST IS THE ALGEBRA TO WHICH 
    THE ELEMENT BELONGS. Entries 1-#a are the basis coefficients 
[X] Define addition, multiplication, subtraction, and Qalgebra structure on FDQA elements
