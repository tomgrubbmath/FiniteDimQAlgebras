# FiniteDimQAlgebras

An FDQA is a Q algebra which is finite dimensional as a vector space over Q. The goal of this project is to add functionality to Macaulay2 for working with FDQAs, such as computing idempotents, computing the prime ideals, finding roots of unity, and solving discrete log type problems.
